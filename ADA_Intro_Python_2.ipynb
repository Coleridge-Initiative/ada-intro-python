    "A boxplot is also used for numerical data, and can be used in a similar manner to histograms in showing the distribution of the data. Instead of putting everything into bins, though, a boxplot plots the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile, along with outer limits and outliers. This makes for a simpler graph, and can be especially useful for comparing the distribution of multiple groups. However, unlike with histograms, you don't get any information about the number of modes.\n",
